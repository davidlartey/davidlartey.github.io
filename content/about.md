Hi, My name is David. I also go by the moniker Dbilovd (The Beloved).  

I was born in 1991 in [Bonny, Nigera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonny,_Rivers). I am from [Prampram, Ghana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prampram).  

I believe in God and I'm learning to live like Jesus Christ.  

I like create things with [code](/projects), [words, and/or music](https://dbilovd.com). 

I am a minimalist at heart.   

I read books, listen to new songs, watch [Arsenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.) and daydream of changing my world.

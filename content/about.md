Hi, I'm David Lartey or Dbilovd (The Beloved).

I was born in 1991 in Bonny, Nigera. I'm from Prampram, Ghana.

I believe in God and I'm learning to live like Jesus Christ.

I am a minimalist at heart.

I like creating things with code, words, and/or music.

I read books, listen to new songs, watch Arsenal and daydream of changing the world.

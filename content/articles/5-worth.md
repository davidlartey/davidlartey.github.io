# Worth

Over the weekend I turned 28 and I read a (biography)[https://www.amazon.com/Heroes-Faith-1927-1956-Barbour-Paperback/dp/1557487324] of (Jim Elliot)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Elliot] and saw (A Private War)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Private_War] - a biography of (Marie Colvin)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Colvin]. Jim and Marie were willing to go far - even to death - for what they believe. This is a way to live the unwasted* life.

As someone who counts comfort as one of my vices, their stories did hit close to home. And at a good time too, as I reflect on the year ahead of me. What am I really ready to die for? What am I willing to trade-in for an unwasted life? Or what is the worth of my beliefs to me? I need to continually ask myself this questions and many more. And also remind myself that:

"he is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain that which he cannot lose."
* I read John Piper's (Don't Waste Your Life)[https://www.desiringgod.org/books/dont-waste-your-life] last month.

# The Hymns for Tomorrow Project

Hello,

For the past 9 to 18 months, I have been going through a number of changes. And one constant thing with every change is the uncertainties of how things will end.

There have been a couple of songs that God is using to bless me and keep my faith grounded in Him. I am putting together some of these songs - of hope - into a project I'm calling: Hymns for Tomorrow.

I plan working on and releasing at least one new song each month for the next 6 to 8 months. The first set of songs My All and Journey will be were released on the 27th of September, 2019.

Do subscribe to my newsletter and follow me on Spotify, SoundCloud, Twitter, Instagram or Facebook to receive notifications when I release a new song.

I am praying that God will reveal Himself to you as the greatest and surest source of hope no matter the situation or uncertainties you are facing.

Thanks

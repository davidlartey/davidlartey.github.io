Yesterday, I worked for a total of about 9 hours. And in that time, I completed about a big part of a USSD application I am working on. Being productive felt really good. 

However, I also noticed the results of focused work over a continuous short period of time. In comparison, if I had worked for 10 hours across 5 days, I know I wouldn't have achieve the same amount of work as I did yesterday. Despite spending more time. I know this because I have tried it previous years.

This isn’t something new*. But it has been a good lesson for me. So over the next few weeks, I will be working to have this as part of my work-life.

The proverbial saying "new year, new beginnings" has never been so surreal to me as it is becoming this year. A good amount of the life I knew in 2018 has changed or will be changing in the next couple of months.


* I relocated to a new place in November
* I am changing jobs
* I am starting a new business
* A long-term relationship came to an end
* My faith was at an all-time low in 2018, a positive change is a MUST this year.


In the midst of all these changes and uncertainties, I can sense mercies and second chances. And this inspires me to start over again. I made massive mistakes in 2018 and previous years that cannot be undone, but I consider myself fortunate to have another chance at life again.


This year, I want to be a novice again. I want to know nothing. I want to learn to code, love, write, sing and serve again. I want to and I am starting over again.


Will I be able to avoid mistakes I've made before? Will I be able to complete this journey I have started? Will I be happy at the end of this year - or my life? I pray I will be but I am not certain of any of those. So much uncertainties but I'm guessing this is what new beginnings are meant for.


As I go through this changes, I plan documenting them daily on this blog. Hopefully, a couple of years down the line, I will look back and laugh at my current fears and worries.

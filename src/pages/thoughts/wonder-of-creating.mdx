It amazes me every time I see something that exists now where nothing existed before. One day there was no me but at some point in history, I became a human being. People, objects, ideas, songs, and even this blog post. It amazes me the more when I am the one that creates that thing.

Over the weekend, my photographs on <a target="_blank" href="https://unsplash.com/@dbilovd">Unsplash</a> crossed 11,000 views and 60 downloads. For most of last year, I had nothing to do with photography. I had no plans of getting of getting a camera. When I got one took some pictures, I didn't share any images outside of WhatsApp statuses. And now, someone somewhere has needed - and hopefully found useful - images I captured, at least 60 times.

I write songs and build software, so I should be used to this feeling, but I never am. And I pray I never do.

If you do any creative work, I’m sure you know this feeling too. I hope you never lose it. And if you haven’t noticed the wonder of something you created lately, please find some time today to pause and marvel at the things you’ve brought to life.

		<h2>Outliers</h2>

		
		
		<div class="post">
			<p>I'm building the habit of retaining more of what I read. To help with that I'll be sharing three thoughts from each book I read.</p>
<p>This month I listened to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)" title="Outliers (book) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" target="_blank">Outliers: The Story of Success</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell" target="_blank" title="Malcom Gladwell - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Malcolm Gladwell</a>. I was drawn to Gladwell for his other book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_and_Goliath:_Underdogs,_Misfits,_and_the_Art_of_Battling_Giants" title="David and Goliath (book) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" target="_blank">David and Goliath</a> which I'm yet to read but what an inspiring read this one has been. This is the first book I've completed since restarting the blog so here are my thoughts:</p>
<h3>Success is Luck</h3>
<p>At least it owes more to luck than I thought it did. Usually, when people say this, they tend use it to prove how unlucky they've been or play down the achievements of someone. Not this time . The author's story at the end of the book went further to prove this. I'll save the details of how lucky I've been for another time but know that I'm a <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+9&version=MSG" target="_blank" title="Romans 9 MSG - God Is Calling His People - At the same - Bible Gateway">lucky one</a> and I think you are too. One just needs to â€˜count their blessings' to see how lucky they are.</p>
<p>An example of someone who considered himself unlucky was <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A14-30&version=MSG" target="_blank" title="Matthew 25:14-30 MSG - The Story About Investment - It's - Bible Gateway">the servant that received one talent</a> from the master. I'm sure he arrived at that conclusion after comparing himself with the other servants. And today its much easier to compare one's self than it has ever been.</p>
<p>Lord, help me not to forget how lucky I am.</p>
<h3>Success is Work</h3>
<p>With luck comes responsibility. 10,000 hours would do what luck wouldn't do. Joseph had to serve Potiphar well - probably after realising how luck he's been to be alive; Bill Gates and Bill Joy had to show up and write the codes. I've been thinking about how many hours of code I've written and one thing is clear, I have to spend way more time doing that than I currently do.</p>
<p>I know not all my interests would get that amount of time, so I shouldn't compare myself with someone who'll give that amount of time because for him/her its not just an interest.</p>
<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitigated_speech" target="_blank" title="Mitigated speech - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Mitigated speeches</a> <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avianca_Flight_52" target="_blank" title="Avianca Flight 52 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">KILL</a></strong></h3>
<p>That deep lying fear or desire for acceptance from authority is not always a good thing. Ghana and Nigeria are <a href="http://www.clearlycultural.com/geert-hofstede-cultural-dimensions/power-distance-index/" target="_blank" title="Power Distance Index | Clearly Cultural">high power-distance index countries</a> so its part of my society and it has affected me more than I'd like it to.</p>
<p>Mind you, it doesn't mean you become mean or something like that, it just means you don't let anyone use a place of authority to deny you anything just because you can't speak up.</p>
<p>However, there is hope. The book reassures that one can still break free no matter how deeply embedded this habit has been in our lives and culture. We shouldn't live life because someone older tells us to but because we've questioned and found out why we ought to live this way or that way.</p>
<p>In conclusion, what I'm taking from the book is this: <strong>"Count your blessings, do the work those blessings require and respect authority but don't let that respect cost you your life."</strong></p>
<p>On a different note, this book has taken my love for Psychology to a whole new level.</p>

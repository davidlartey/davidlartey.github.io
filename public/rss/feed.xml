            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, YouTube&#x27;s algorithm suggested Burna Boy&#x27;s music video for the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8560CAdA0Ys" target="_blank_bbyt">Common Person</a>. While watching it, I noticed that almost every scene filled my heart with nostalgia and joy. You see, more than half of my life so far was spent on Bonny Island, an hour or so from Port Harcourt, where I think the music video was shot.</p>
<p>However, there was this scene that meant more to me. Not only did this scene bring nostalgic joys but it was also screaming to me: &quot;David, see how far we&#x27;ve come. David, see how far we&#x27;ve come!&quot; That was the scene of an entire family of 6 or 7 sharing a single room. Siblings were lying on mattresses on the floor and some curtains to give some form of privacy. That was a picture of my family for most of my life.</p>
<p>This reminder to look back and count how far we&#x27;ve come as a family could not have come at a more appropriate time - especially regarding our housing situation. You see, my parents just moved into their new house, and for the first time in their lives, they are no longer tenants. And not only that, they are now going to be ones collecting rent as landlord and landlady. It wasn&#x27;t that I had forgotten where we came from - I don&#x27;t think I ever will. However, I really needed to see that video in this season so my gratitude would go beyond the past 6 to 24 months.</p>
<p>I have been observing something, that there can be a temptation to be recency-biased when it comes to the things we are grateful for. When you come through a challenging situation and get some breakthroughs, it&#x27;s easy to just focus most of ones gratitude on only the recent challenging situation you came through, but I think this can limit our gratitude. Not that we shouldn&#x27;t be grateful for recent events (I am personally celebrating 6-months of God&#x27;s ‚Äúhw…õ so pa‚Äù) but we need to expand it beyond our recent pains, we&#x27;ve come come a long way. No short or long-sighted kind of gratitude, but 20/20 gratitude. My friend Jo recently shared a version of this phenomenon in her notes on <a href="https://web.facebook.com/josephine.abenaamofaahnketiah/posts/pfbid02QwGq5TdRw9XyErBBeZsAVtyLKtFDGjFSPtG4iCY4hiDobsr5qjQGV5bd7r3dYhaRl" target="_blank"> Leah and Judah</a>.</p>
<p>This new space for my parents, was one of two things I was trusting God for last year. In fact I was so sure of having both of them that at the beginning of last year that I shared a testimony with a small group at church about it. But as God would have it, I ended the year without any. And now, that this one has come to pass, there is the temptation to limit my praise and gratitude for just the past few months. However, that video helped me overcome that shortsightedness and truly consider and see how far we&#x27;ve come. From a family of 6 sharing a single room, to now owning two homes (my sister and parents) and me renting a third that is the kind of place my younger self (and my family) could only dream of living in some years ago.</p>
<p>See! David, see!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Worth</h1>
<p>Over the weekend I turned 28 and I read a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heroes-Faith-1927-1956-Barbour-Paperback/dp/1557487324" target="_blank">biography</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Elliot" target="_blank">Jim Elliot</a> and saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Private_War" target="_blank">A Private War</a> - a biography of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Colvin" target="_blank">Marie Colvin</a>. Jim and Marie were willing to go far - even to death - for what they believe. This is a way to live the un-wasted* life.</p>
<p>As someone who counts comfort as one of my vices, their stories did hit close to home. And at a good time too, as I reflect on the year ahead of me. What am I really ready to die for? What am I willing to trade-in for an unwasted life? Or what is the worth of my beliefs to me? I need to continually ask myself this questions and many more. And also remind myself that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...he is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain that which he cannot lose.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>* I read John Piper&#x27;s <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/books/dont-waste-your-life" target="_blank">Don&#x27;t Waste Your Life</a> last month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I worked for a total of about 9 hours. And in that time, I completed about a big part of a USSD application I am working on. Being productive felt really good.</p>
<p>However, I also noticed the results of focused work over a continuous short period of time. In comparison, if I had worked for 10 hours across 5 days, I know I wouldn&#x27;t have achieve the same amount of work as I did yesterday. Despite spending more time. I know this because I have tried it previous years.</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt something new*. But it has been a good lesson for me. So over the next few weeks, I will be working to have this as part of my work-life.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Problem:</h2>
<p>I am currently working on a USSD application that supports switching between different gateway providers at runtime by changing a configuration value.</p>
<p>Testing each provider test case was simple and straight forward. I would update the value in my phpunit.xml file and off I go. However, I ran into problems when I wanted to run my entire test suite.</p>
<h2>The Solution:</h2>
<p>It turns out the solution is quite a simple one: Facades. Laravel allows one to mock any Facade when writing your tests. The documentation however, discourages from mocking the Config facade. Instead one should use the Config::set method.</p>
<p>So, I did something along the lines of the code below.</p>
<pre class="language-php"><code class="language-php"><span class="token php language-php"><span class="token delimiter important">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="token comment">// define your namespace and dependencies here</span>

<span class="token keyword">use</span> <span class="token package">Illuminate<span class="token punctuation">\</span>Support<span class="token punctuation">\</span>Facades<span class="token punctuation">\</span>Config</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name-definition class-name">GatewayProviderOneTest</span> <span class="token keyword">extends</span> <span class="token class-name">TestCase</span>
<span class="token punctuation">{</span>
	<span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function-definition function">setUp</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
	<span class="token punctuation">{</span>
		<span class="token scope"><span class="token keyword">parent</span><span class="token punctuation">::</span></span><span class="token function">setUp</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
		<span class="token scope">Config<span class="token punctuation">::</span></span><span class="token function">set</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string double-quoted-string">&quot;defaultGatewayProvider&quot;</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string double-quoted-string">&quot;firstProvider&quot;</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
	<span class="token punctuation">}</span>

	<span class="token comment">// ... your test methods come here</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>That‚Äôs all I needed. Now <code>GatewayProviderOneTest</code> will run its assertions against the value set as the defaultGatewayProvider: firstProvider.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can revert this to a default value every time in your <code>tearDown</code> method. I however didn‚Äôt have the need for this.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am trying to read the whole Bible this year. I have tried four or five times already but haven‚Äôt been able to complete it.</p>
<p>Today I read the creation story. One thing that caught my attention was the amount of time God used in completing the earth project. I have been - and I‚Äôm still - awed at how He made it all in 7 days. Today however, I am awed by how He didn‚Äôt choose to do it in a way shorter time.</p>
<p>On the first day, God spoke just 6 words (I use the NLT). And the next day just over 20 words. I thought about what I would have done and it is very likely that I would have attempted speaking no less that 10 to 20 words every minute. I would have strived to do it all in 30 minutes or less. But God took His time: 6 words the first day.</p>
<p>How often I try to do too much in a short time and how often I fail and become impatient with my growth. Yes, the line between being patient and being lazy is thin sometimes but the story of creation is one of patience. For things to grow, I need to give them time.</p>
<p>As I start over this year, I pray I build a strong habit of patience, allowing things to happen in time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The proverbial saying &quot;new year, new beginnings&quot; has never been so surreal to me as it is becoming this year. A good amount of the life I knew in 2018 has changed or will be changing in the next couple of months.</p>
<ul>
<li>I relocated to a new place in November</li>
<li>I am changing jobs</li>
<li>I am starting a new business</li>
<li>A long-term relationship came to an end</li>
<li>My faith was at an all-time low in 2018, a positive change is a MUST this year.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the midst of all these changes and uncertainties, I can sense mercies and second chances. And this inspires me to start over again. I made massive mistakes in 2018 and previous years that cannot be undone, but I consider myself fortunate to have another chance at life again.</p>
<p>This year, I want to be a novice again. I want to know nothing. I want to learn to code, love, write, sing and serve again. I want to and I am starting over again.</p>
<p>Will I be able to avoid mistakes I&#x27;ve made before? Will I be able to complete this journey I have started? Will I be happy at the end of this year - or my life? I pray I will be but I am not certain of any of those. So much uncertainties but I&#x27;m guessing this is what new beginnings are meant for.</p>
<p>As I go through this changes, I plan documenting them daily on this blog. Hopefully, a couple of years down the line, I will look back and laugh at my current fears and worries.</p>]]></content:encoded>
